# Credit-Card-Fraud-Detection
Task 5 Credit Card Fraud Detection

This project focuses on building a machine learning model to detect fraudulent credit card transactions. By analyzing transaction data and addressing challenges like class imbalance, it ensures accurate identification of fraudulent activities.

# Project Overview
Preprocess and normalize data.
.Handle imbalanced data using techniques like oversampling (SMOTE) or undersampling.
.Train models like logistic regression or random forests.
.Evaluate using metrics like precision, recall, and F1-score.

# How to Run the Project
Open the Jupyter notebook fraud_detection.ipynb and follow the steps to preprocess data, train the model, and evaluate its performance.

# Highlights
Data Preparation: Clean and normalize transaction data.
Imbalance Handling: Use oversampling or undersampling to balance fraud vs. genuine cases.
Model Evaluation: Ensure accuracy with precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrix.
This project creates a complete pipeline to detect credit card fraud efficiently and reliably.
